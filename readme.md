## Overview

This repository is a collection of LeetCode problems that I’ve been solving as part of my coding practice. The problems are categorized into different folders based on the source or topic. Each solution includes:
- Problem description or a link to the LeetCode page
- My thought process and approach to the problem
- The code implementation
- Complexity analysis (time and space)

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into the following key folders:

1. **`drafts/`**  
   This folder contains random algorithm and data structure problems that I have worked on. These are either unsorted or drafts for later refinement.

2. **`TT/`**  
   Contains questions from the TikTok internship question bank. These problems helped me prepare for my internship interviews.

3. **`dp/`**  
   This is a dedicated folder for **dynamic programming (DP)** problems. It contains solutions to various DP-related questions, one of the most important topics in coding interviews.

4. **`top150/`**  
   This folder includes solutions to the top 150 most popular questions on LeetCode. Solving these provides broad coverage of key coding concepts and problem types.
